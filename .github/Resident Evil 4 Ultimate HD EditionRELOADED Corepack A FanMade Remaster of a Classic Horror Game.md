Resident Evil 4 is one of the most acclaimed and influential games in the survival horror genre, originally released in 2005 for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. It follows the story of Leon S. Kennedy, a former police officer who is sent to a rural village in Spain to rescue the U.S. president's daughter from a cult that has infected the locals with a parasitic virus. The game features a third-person perspective, dynamic camera angles, and an innovative over-the-shoulder aiming system that allows for more precise and immersive combat.

In 2014, Capcom released Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition for PC, which was an improved port of the original game with enhanced graphics, sound, and performance. However, some fans were not satisfied with the quality of the port and decided to create their own HD remaster of the game, using high-resolution textures, models, lighting, and effects. The project, led by Albert Marin and his small team, took seven years to complete and was released for free in February 2022.
 
The HD project is not a mod or a patch, but a complete overhaul of the game's graphics that requires a copy of Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition on Steam to install. The project does not alter the gameplay or the story of the game, but only improves its visual fidelity and atmosphere. The team used various techniques to enhance the game's graphics, such as using photos or AI to recreate some of the original textures from scratch, while staying faithful to the aesthetic of the original game. The team also updated the cutscenes and menus with higher resolution assets.
 
The HD project has received praise from fans and critics alike for its impressive work and dedication. The project has also been endorsed by Capcom, who pinned a forum post about it on Resident Evil 4's Steam page. The HD project is compatible with other mods and patches for Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition, such as unlockers or localizations. The HD project is available for download from various sources listed on its official website.
 
If you are a fan of Resident Evil 4 or survival horror games in general, you should definitely check out this fan-made remaster that breathes new life into a classic game.

Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition-RELOADED Corepack not only offers improved graphics, but also some new gameplay features that enhance the experience and challenge of the game. Some of these features are:
 
- **Parry**: A new parry action has been added that allows you to counter incoming enemy attacks using a knife. This can be used to stagger enemies and create openings for melee strikes or headshots. Parrying requires precise timing and reduces the durability of the knife.
- **Knife Durability**: Knife durability is a new mechanic in the game that indicates the condition of Leon's Combat Knife. The knife can break if used too much, especially for blocking attacks or stabbing enemies to get out of being grabbed. If broken, you'll have to find a replacement knife or repair it at the Merchant.
- **Crouching and Emergency Dodge**: Leon can now crouch to avoid detection, get under obstacles, or dodge certain attacks. Crouching can also be used to sneak up behind enemies and stab them silently with the knife. Emergency Dodge is a new move that allows Leon to quickly roll away from danger when prompted.
- **New Enemies**: The game features some new enemies that pose new threats and challenges to Leon. These include the Regenerators, which can regenerate their limbs and organs unless shot with a special rifle scope; the Iron Maidens, which are Regenerators with spikes that can impale Leon; the Novistadors, which are insect-like creatures that can fly and turn invisible; and the Armaduras, which are suits of armor possessed by parasites.
- **New Weapons**: The game also introduces some new weapons that can be found or bought from the Merchant. These include the Bolt Thrower, which is a silent crossbow that can fire bolts with different effects, such as explosives or flashbangs; the P.R.L. 412, which is a laser weapon that can vaporize enemies; the Chicago Typewriter, which is a powerful Tommy gun with infinite ammo; and the Handcannon, which is a massive revolver that can blow off enemy heads.
- **New Merchant Requests**: The Merchant now has some new requests for Leon that can reward him with money or items. These include finding rare treasures, killing certain enemies, completing challenges, or collecting bottle caps.
- **Item Crafting**: Leon can now craft some items using materials found in the environment or dropped by enemies. These include healing items, ammo, grenades, mines, and traps.
- **New Costumes**: The game features some new costumes for Leon and Ashley that can be unlocked by completing certain modes or achievements. These include Leon's R.P.D. uniform from Resident Evil 2, Ashley's pop star outfit, Ada's spy suit from Separate Ways, and more.

These new gameplay features add more variety, depth, and replay value to Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition-RELOADED Corepack, making it a definitive version of one of the best games ever made.
